				In Texas, Missing Persons Reports Increased by Nearly 300% in 2021, and the Number Continues to Climb. Here’s Why.

			<h2> In 2021, Texas passed legislation requiring law enforcement to report missing persons to a national database for the first time, but there are still enormous barriers to locating the disappeared. </h2>

				<p class="intro"> When people go missing in the United States, ideally, their case numbers end up in a database called “NamUs”.  
				</p>
				 <p>
				NamUs – an apropos acronym for, “National Missing and Unidentified Persons System” – is the central location for medical examiners, law enforcement, and families of missing loved ones to enter information about individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the U.S., law enforcement do not have very effective methods for cross-jurisdiction communication and data sharing. If someone is reported missing in one county, and then they are found – alive or dead – in another, the case records may never be matched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaceyHullForTexas/videos/watch-kxan-discusses-john-and-josephs-law/1300688626970913/?_rdr"> unless both are entered in NamUs</a>. This can leave loved ones in the dark to agonize over the fate of the absentee, when a medical examiner in another state may already have recorded that person’s death.
				</p>
				<p>
				Even though this database is designed to help in the location and identification of the disappeared, it is not used consistently by law enforcement agencies. In fact, at the time of this writing, only <a href="https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/frequently-asked-questions#21-0"> 16 states</a> currently have legislation that mandates missing persons be entered into the NamUs system.

				In February of 2021, Texas passed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaceyHullForTexas/videos/watch-kxan-discusses-john-and-josephs-law/1300688626970913/?_rdr">John and Joseph’s Law</a>, which suddenly required law enforcement to use NamUs; before, it had been optional. The number of missing persons listed in Texas’ NamUs database then jumped from 87 people in 2020, to 234 people in 2021, and has continued to increase annually. 
				</p>
				<p>
				There is also significant variance to the timelines within which law enforcement are required to produce a NamUs report. <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S6739">In New York</a>, for instance, police must enter missing adults into the system within 30 days; in Texas, the limit is 60 days.
				</p>
				<p>
				“It's supposed to be through insurance carriers,” said Metwally. “However, within our area, unfortunately, many homeowners are underinsured. They have the bare minimum of policies that in most cases don't cover [the cost of the damage].”
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from the varying requirements around data entry, and aside from poor communication amongst police, there are other major roadblocks to locating the missing.

				Melissa Turnquist is one of three staff members at the Houston-based nonprofit, Texas Center for the Missing. She said that she and her coworkers – not the Texas Police Academy – <a href="https://centerforthemissing.org/law-enforcement-trainings/">are the authority training Greater Houston Area police</a> on how to handle basic missing persons tasks, such as how to issue an <a href="https://amberalert.ojp.gov/about/faqs">Amber Alert</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Guiding law enforcement is not the only responsibility shouldered by Turnquist and her tiny team. Texas Center for the Missing also offers hands-on support to the families searching for vanished loved ones. They print and distribute missing persons flyers, contact regional shelters, host media events to draw attention to the cases, and post cases across social media.
			</p>
			<p>
				“There is no funding for finding missing persons. There is no [internal] training for police,” said Turnquist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Per tax documents, her organization’s revenue was just $1.4M in 2023.
			</p>
			<p>
				On top of their neverending work with both families and law enforcement, Texas Center for the Missing also hosts Missing in Southeast Texas, an annual event for the loved ones of the disappeared. Families can enter their missing relative’s name into the NamUs database, submit their own DNA swabs for a potential identification match, utilize Ai software to create age-adjusted portraits, and register Amber or <a href="https://www.chp.ca.gov/news-alerts/silver-alert#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Silver%20Alert?%20A%20Silver,recovery%20of%20at%2Drisk%20persons%20meeting%20the%20criteria.">Silver Alerts</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s sort of a ‘one stop shop’ for the community,” said Turnquist.
			</p>
			<p>
				Turnquist said her organization receives all their support from fundraising events, foundations, individual donors, and government grants. I asked her what types of support they would like to see in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				“More funding. That’s the big missing piece. People often don’t understand that there is no funding for these programs. And share those missing persons flyers. People feel compassion fatigue, and I get that, but [missing persons and their families] really need people to circulate these flyers. A lot of runaways go home once they see their picture on a flyer,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
				I asked Mz. Turnquist if there is anything else she wanted readers to know, and learned something surprising when she answered.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Many people think you have to wait 24 hours before you report someone missing. The 24 hour waiting period is a <a href="https://childfindofamerica.org/my-child-is-missing/#:~:text=Call%20the%20Police%20Immediately,waiting%20period%20is%20a%20myth.">myth</a>!” she said.
